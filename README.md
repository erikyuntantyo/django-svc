# SIMPLE CRUD API WITH DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
[Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.4
- Django 4.1.13
- Django REST Framework
- Djongo

## Installation
After you cloned the repository, you want to create a virtual environment, so you have a clean python installation.
You can do this by running the command
```
python -m venv env
```

After this, it is necessary to activate the virtual environment, you can get more information about this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

You can install all the required dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints should be logically organized around _collections_ and _elements_, both of which are resources.

In our case, we have one single resource, `songs`, so we will use the following URLS - `/songs/` and `/songs/<id>` for collections and elements, respectively:

Endpoint |HTTP Method | CRUD Method | Result
-- | -- |-- |--
`songs` | GET | READ | Get all songs
`songs/:id` | GET | READ | Get a single movie
`songs`| POST | CREATE | Create a new movie
`songs/:id` | PUT | UPDATE | Update a movie
`songs/:id` | DELETE | DELETE | Delete a movie

## Use
We can test the API using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#installation), or we can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
